# Adamski Family Reunion Website

### STATUS - In Progress

* This is a site designed to host images taken from my family's reunion party.
* It will feature a dual authentication (Devise & OAuth - Facebook/ *maybe Google*)
* Image hosting will be taken care of with AWS and CarrierWave
* Backend will be Rails and PostgreSQL with the front-end being mostly Rails
* React to be used for User Index page for a more dynamic experience (scrolling list of users and stateful rendering of associated user cards to the right)

### Instructions

* Run `npm install`
* Run `rails s` in your terminal and `npm start` in another tab from your terminal
